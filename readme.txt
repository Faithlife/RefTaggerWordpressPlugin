Reftagger turns Bible references into links to the verse on Biblia.com and adds tooltips with the text of the verse.

== Description ==

This plugin provides an easy way to use the Reftagger Bible reference tagging script from Logos Bible Software. It automatically modifies your site to run the script each time a page loads. The script identifies references to Bible verses and turns the references into links to the verse on Biblia.com. Hovering over a link will display a small tooltip containing the text of the reference, so users don't need to leave the page to view the verse. If desired, a small icon can also be inserted next to the reference. Clicking the icon will open the specified verse in Logos Bible Software, if available. The plugin provides a simple options page where you can customize the settings.

Customizable preferences include: 

* Which Bible version to link to.
* Option to insert a Logos link after each reference.
* Option to insert a Logos icon after any Logos links you already have on your site.
* Choice of which icon to use if Logos links are enabled.
* Option to enable or disable hover tooltips.
* Option to work on existing Biblia.com and Ref.ly links.
* Option to work on Bible references that use improper casing (e.g., jn 3:16 or JOHN 3:16).
* Option to tag chapter references (e.g. Gen 1).
* Option to prevent searching user comments for references.
* Option to prevent searching specific HTML tags, such as bold, h1, ordered list, etc.
