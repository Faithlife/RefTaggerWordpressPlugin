Faithlife Reftagger turns Bible references into links to the verse on Biblia.com and adds tooltips with the text of the verse.

== Description ==

Faithlife Reftagger is a service which automatically converts Bible references on your site into links so your site’s visitors can see Scripture just by hovering over the link. Reftagger modifies your site to run the tagging script each time a page loads, identifying Bible verse references and turning them into links to the verse on Biblia.com.

Hovering over a link displays a tooltip with the text of the reference, so users don’t need to leave the page to see the verse. You can also insert a small icon next to the reference to open the verse in Logos Bible Software.

The plugin provides a simple options page where you can customize settings. Preferences include options to:

* Specify a Bible version.
* Insert a Logos link after each reference.
* Insert a Logos icon after existing Logos links on your site.
* Choose which icon to use if Logos links are enabled.
* Enable or disable hover tooltips.
* Work on existing Biblia.com and Ref.ly links.
* Work on Bible references with improper casing (such as jn 3:16 or JOHN 3:16).
* Tag chapter references (such as Gen. 1).
* Prevent searching user comments for references.
* Prevent searching specific HTML tags (such as bold, h1, ordered list).

This plugin relies on the Faithlife Reftagger API service (api.reftagger.com) to make this tagging possible. By using this plugin and corresponding service, you are accept Faithlife Reftagger API's Privacy Policy (https://faithlife.com/products/reftagger/privacy) and Terms of Use (https://faithlife.com/terms).
